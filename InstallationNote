Setting up Ubuntu 16.04 + CUDA + GPU 

Mostly based on:

Note: Step 2, no need to turn off XServer and stuff, only need to follow John comment and do the installation of CUDA based on

John:

I have a question regarding ubuntu 16.04 and loading the Nvidia CUDA driver.
it seems to me that the instructions for loading the nvidia driver are for ubuntu 14, and below, which is the exact method I had to always use before to get the nvidia driver loaded and use CUDA

With Ubuntu 16.04 , all you need to do is go to Software & Updates -> Additional Drivers, and the Nvidia binary driver shows up , just load it , and thats it , no need to turn off X or go into the command line, turn off nouveau , lightdm stop/start etc . CUDA and all its examples once compiled work fine with no issue. At least thats what I did months ago and have had no issues using the GPU and CUDA. After a reboot all the latest / new Nvidia drivers as released also show up tin Additiona Drivers, to load if you want to . The driver that initially shows up is 381.22 but after that later drivers up to 384.90 show up to easily load.

Not sure if Im missing something loading the Nvidia driver with this easy method

Other methods might lead to several problems (mostly related to NVIDIA drivers installation), this link might help with those issues:

Should install CUDA 8.0 + TensorFlow 1.4


Setting Gym + Mujoco:
